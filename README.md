What follows is a messy dialogue of what goes on in Peru's head as he is coding.

### WOW, there's a lot to do

### Mobile App

> We're starting on the Mobile App next :) - Peru, Oct 25th

> Please start on the Mobile App soon  - Peru, Oct 16th

> Can the website goal for v1 be a 10 friend event? Then my brain won't worry about every feature on the website - Peru, Oct 17th


#### Small things that will go a long way

- Drizzle Migrations - Create a cmd to easily apply migrations to prod
- Button to create mock Race
- Wire up UserContext

#### A defintely doable albeit long list of everything else

Once we have tickets:
- Update the dashboard to show basic stats.
- Add social links to website - this could be a good one for Colin?

And then we improve the Stripe worklow
- Ability to buy multiple tickets
- An input form for Waivers / Basic Info
- Add support for taxes - https://stripe.com/tax
- Add support for discount codes???

And then the Race Management Page.
- Oof, there's a lot

Bugs:
- Sign In -> Sign Up losses the redirect url

### Take 3: Future Improvements:
- Clean up the Type definitions a bit more, might be worth manually defining the types
- Seperate npm command for Prod Migration?
- Prod Migrations on deploy via Vercel hook?
- Autosave + Media changes should save?
- Define Supabase Buckets using migrations
- Define Supabase RLS using Drizzle: https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/rls#using-with-supabase

### Supabase

Local supabase setup:
- Run supabase locally using docker for testing.
- `supabase init` to create a config folder
- `supabase start` to start the supabase server in dockernpm
- `supabase stop` to stop the docker instance, data will persist.

### Drizzle

Src: https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started/supabase-new

Schema & Migrations
- Update the schema in db/schema.
- Generate a migration using `npx drizzle-kit generate`
- Apply the migration using `npx drizzle-kit migrate`
- Created `npm run migrate` to do both of these.

### Supabase User Auth

Src: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth

Overview
- JWTs for Authentication
- JWT is stored in the cookie
- Cookie is stored on the client side browser
- Cookie is send to the server with every request
- Cookie is authenticated and refreshed by the middleware
- supabase.getUser() is the best authentication as it hits the database.
- I like and will be using fucking server actions.

### Prod Migrations
- Switch the DATABASE_URL in .env
- Run `npm run migrate`
- This is bad and I will clean up the workflow

### Stripe!!
- There's so much happening here, and so much more to do
- Everything starts in the Stripe dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/acct_1SCM6MJHWd8FMlJA/test/payments
- The STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY define which stripe project/env we are connected to. 
- Both local and prod are currently pointing to the Sandbox env.

- Once we are connected to a Stripe account, the magic starts from the CheckoutButton.tsx
- We require Auth to buy a ticket.
- We call the /api/stripe/checkout endpoint which gives us a URL for the stripe connect page
- This API endpoint passes in a PriceObject to the stripe checkout session. The Metadata passed in gets passed through the webhook to our api endpoint.
- We redirect the users to this page
- This page handles checkout
- On successfully checkout, a Webhook (configured on the Stripe Dashboard) is triggered
- We are currently only listening to the checkout.session.completed on the Sandbox webhook.
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is the Webhook secret key. 
- This webhook calls the /api/stripe/webhook route
- We can then save our ticket in the DB and send emails and whatever else.

- For local testing
- In a new Iterm run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook`
- This will give you a STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET for local testing
- Disabling the webhook seemed to have worked. But that'll be a headache.
- Having both the webhook and local listener results in both getting called, which will mess up the prod DB during local dev.
- Probably two sandboxes is the way to go. Dev and Stg.
